# Lorenzo-Trueba Mariotti (LTM) Model
This repository contains code for the LTM model, originally described in Lorenzo-Trueba and Mariotti (2017). The LTM model is a cross-sectional, process-based numerical model designed to simulate the long-term geomorphic evolution of an idealized barrier–marsh–lagoon–marsh system. A simplified version of the LTM model was applied in Tenebruso et al. (2022), and this repository includes both the original and simplified implementations. The current Julia version was developed by Eric Dammann based on the original MATLAB code.
